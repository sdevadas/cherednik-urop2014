\begin{abstract}
We study the polynomial representation of the rational Cherednik algebra of type $A_{n-1}$ with generic parameter in characteristic $p$ for $p \mid n$. We give explicit formulas for generators for the maximal ideal, show that they cut out a complete intersection, and thus compute the Hilbert series of the irreducible quotient. Our methods are motivated by generalizing from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$.

\section{Introduction}

In this paper we study lowest-weight representations of rational Cherednik algebras associated to the symmetric group $S_n$ in characteristic $p$ dividing $n$. This problem is an interesting test case for moving results from characteristic $0$ to positive characteristic. Cherednik algebras, originally double affine Hecke algebras, were introduced by Cherednik in 1993; for an introduction to these algebras we refer to \cite{EM}. The representation theory of these algebras has been studied more extensively in characteristic $0$ than in positive characteristic, including the case of Cherednik algebras of type $A_{n-1}$ (associated to the symmetric group $S_n$). In general new techniques are required to study positive characteristic as opposed to characteristic 0. In this paper we directly connect the characteristic 0 case for the polynomial representation to the positive characteristic case; the irreducible representation of the Cherednik algebra in this case is the quotient of the polynomial representation by an ideal generated by complex residues. In the positive characteristic case, we instead let the generators be the coefficients of formal power series. In particular our argument that this quotient is a complete intersection is directly analogous to the corresponding argument in \cite{CE}, though with additional `error terms' that emerge because we must truncate the power series so that we can define it in positive characteristic. We are able to truncate the power series because we realize the $(n-1)$-dimensional representation $\h$ of $S_n$ as a quotient by the sum of the basis elements rather than as the reflection representation.

While we only consider the case of the symmetric group $S_n$ in this paper, this technique could also be used for the general case of complex reflection groups. %this bit needs revisions

\subsection{Definitions}

Given the symmetric group $S_n$, we let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of reflections in $S_n$. Let $\h$ be the irreducible $(n-1)$-dimensional representation of $S_n$, realized as the submodule of $k^n$ where the sum of the coordinates is $0$. For each $s \in \mathcal{S}$ we assign a vector $\alpha_s \in \h^*$ spanning the image of $1-s$, and choose $\alpha_s^\vee \in \h$ so that $(1-s)x=\langle \alpha_s^\vee,x\rangle \alpha_s$ for all $x \in \h^*$, where $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ indicates the pairing between $\h$ and $\h^*$. 

Let $T(\h \oplus \h^*)$ be the tensor algebra of $\h \oplus \h^*$. We choose $\hbar,c \in k$. Then we define the {\it rational Cherednik algebra of type $A$} $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)$ as the quotient of $k[S_n] \ltimes T(\h \oplus \h^*)$ by the relations
\begin{align*}
[x,x']=0, \quad [y,y' = 0], \quad [y,x] = \hbar\langle y,x\rangle - \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} c\langle y,\alpha_s\rangle\langle \alpha_s^\vee,x\rangle s
\end{align*}
 for all $x,x' \in \h^*, y,y' \in \h$. We can give $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)$ a $\mathbb{Z}$-grading by setting $\deg x=1$ for $x \in \h^*$, $\deg y = -1$ for $y \in \h$, and $\deg g=0$ for $g \in k[G]$. We get the PBW-type decomposition $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)=\Sym(\h) \otimes_k k[S_n] \otimes_k \Sym(\h^*)$ (\cite[Section 3.2]{EM}). 

In general, for any $\alpha \ne 0$, $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)\simeq \HH_{\alpha\hbar,\alpha c}(\h)$, so we restrict to $\hbar=0$ or $\hbar = 1$. 

\subsection{Representations of rational Cherednik algebras}

We are concerned with the {\it polynomial representation} $\Sym(\h^*)$ of $\HH_{\hbar,c}$, which is a polynomial ring. We refer to the polynomial representation as $A$; we can give this a $\mathbb{Z}$-grading in an obvious way. 

As described in Section 2.5 of \cite{BC1}, $A=\Sym(\h^*)$ has a unique maximal graded proper submodule $J$ which can be realized as the kernel of the contravariant form $\beta_c: \Sym(\h^*) \times \Sym(\h) \to k$; $\beta_c$ can be characterized by the property that for all $x \in \h^*, y \in \h, f \in \Sym(\h^*), g \in  \Sym(\h)$:
\begin{align*}
\beta_c(xf,g)=\beta_c(f,xg), \quad \beta_c(f,yg) = \beta_c(yf,g), \quad \beta_c(1,1) = 1.
\end{align*}
The quotient $A/J$ is a finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathbb{Z}$-graded representation of $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)$. The {\it Hilbert series} $h_{A/J}(t)$ of $A/J$ is $\sum_{j=0}^\infty (\dim_k L_j)t^k$ where $L_j$ is the $j$-graded factor of $A/J$. 

\subsection{Main results}

For a formal power series or Laurent series $r(z)$, we write the coefficient of $z^\ell$ in $r$ as $[z^\ell]r(z)$. 

 We call $c$ {\it generic} if we do not specify its value. We will be concerned with the case $\hbar=1$, $c$ generic, and the characteristic $p$ of $k$ dividing $n$. We realize $\h$ as the subspace of $k^n$ with the sum of the coordinates $0$, which is an irreducible representation of $S_n$ of dimension $n-1$. We state our result for this case below:
 
 \newtheorem*{thm:main}{Theorem \ref{thm:main}}
\begin{thm:main} The irreducible representation $A/J$  of $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)$ is a complete intersection with  Hilbert series $\left(\frac{1-t^p}{1-t}\right)^{n-1}$. The maximal ideal $J$ is generated by $[z^p]F_a(z)$ for the formal power series
\[
F_a(z)=\frac{1}{1-x_az} \prod_{j=0}^{n-1}\left( \sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k}(-1+\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} (1-x_jz))^k\right) \text{ for $a=0,\dots,n-2$}.
\]
\end{thm:main}

%We assume $p>2$ since the case $p=2$ is fully characterized in \cite{L}.

\subsection{Connections to previous work}

Our study is motivated by previous work on the representation theory of the type $A$ rational Cherednik algebra in both characteristic $0$ and $p$.  In characteristic $p = 2$ with $p \mid n$, it was shown in \cite[Theorem 5.1]{L} that the irreducible quotient of the polynomial representation associated to the $n$-dimensional reflection representation is a complete intersection and that the corresponding maximal ideal is generated by $n - 1$ elements of degree $2$ and a single element of degree $4$.  In particular, this implies that the Hilbert series is 
\[
h(t) = (1 + t)^n (1 + t^2).
\]
It was conjectured by C.~Lian in \cite[Conjecture 5.2]{L} that for all $p$ the corresponding irreducible is a complete intersection with maximal ideal having $n - 1$ generators in degree $p$ and a single generator in degree $p^2$.  Our results are consistent with the restriction of Lian's conjecture to the case when $\h$ is restricted to the $(n - 1)$-dimensional quotient.  It would be interesting to extend our work to prove Lian's conjecture in full.

In characteristic $0$, our results parallel the explicit decomposition of the polynomial representation of the type $A$ rational Cherednik algebra given in \cite{BEG, CE}.  There, the polynomial representation is irreducible unless $c = \frac{r}{n}$ for some integer $r$, and an explicit set of generators of the maximal ideal is known.
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 3.1]{CE}}] \label{prop:ce}
If $\char(k) = 0$ and $c = \frac{r}{n}$, the maximal ideal $J \subset A$ of the polynomial representation $A$ of $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)$ is generated by
\[
\Res_\infty\left[\frac{dz}{z-x_j} \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (z-x_i)^c\right] \text{ for $j=0,\dots,n-2$}.
\]
\end{proposition}
We interpret the characteristic $p$ analogue of Proposition \ref{prop:ce} to mean that if $r = p$ and $p \mid n$, then taking $c = \frac{p}{n}$ should correspond to taking generic $c$.  While this substitution is of course invalid, Proposition \ref{prop:ce} may be interpreted as a statement about certain formal power series.  By using a power series version of this construction of generators which  makes sense in characteristic $p$, we are able to mimic the arguments of \cite{BEG, CE} to show that they cut out a complete intersection and generate the entire ideal.  We believe that the philosophy of taking characteristic $p$ analogues of characteristic $0$ results for the rational Cherednik algebra should apply more generally and hope to explore this further in future work.

\section{The rational Cherednik algebra}
 
\subsection{Dunkl operators}

To understand the action of $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)$ on $A$, we can use the PBW decompositions. The action of $\Sym(\h^*)$ on $A$ is by left multiplication; $k[S_n]$ acts by the diagonal action, and $\Sym(\h)$ acts via {\it Dunkl operators}. For $y \in \h$, the Dunkl operator $D_y$ acts on $A$ by:
\begin{align*}
D_y(f) = \hbar \partial_y f  - \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} c \frac{ ( y, \alpha_s )}{\alpha_s} (1-s). f.
\end{align*}
We choose bases for $\h,\h^*$ in the following way: let $V$ be the vector space spanned by $y_0,\dots,y_{n-1}$ and let $\h$ be the subspace spanned by $y_i-y_j$ for $i \ne j$; $S_n$ acts by permuting indices. Then if $x_0,\dots,x_{n-1}$ is the dual basis for $V^*$, we see that $\h^*$ is the span of $x_0,\dots,x_{n-1}$ under the relation $x_0+\dots+x_{n-1}=0$; alternatively we can consider $\h^*$ as the span of $x_0,\dots,x_{n-2}$ with $x_{n-1}$ defined as $-x_0-\dots-x_{n-2}$.  If $D_i$ is the Dunkl operator corresponding to $y_i$, the Dunkl operators for the elements of $\h$ are spanned by $D_i-D_j$ with $i \ne j$. 

For a transposition $s_{ij} \in S_n$ with $i<j$, we let the corresponding vector $\alpha_{s_{ij}} \in \h^*$ be $x_i-x_j$.

\section{Proof of the main result}

We let $g(z)=\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} (1-x_jz)$. Let $F_a(z)$ for $a=0,\dots,n-1$ be the formal power series in $z$ defined by $F_a(z)=\frac{1}{1-x_az} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k}(g-1)^k\right)$ where $\binom{c}{k}=\frac{c(c-1)\dots(c-k+1)}{k!}$. 

Because of the definition of the contravariant form $\beta_c$, showing that an element $f$ of $A$ is in the kernel of $\beta_c$ is equivalent to showing that the Dunkl operators corresponding to the basis elements of $\h$ annihilate $f$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:ann} Let $f_a=[z^p]F_a(z)$. Then $f_a$ for $a=0,\dots,n-1$ are annihilated by the Dunkl operators. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since $x_{n-1}=-x_0-\dots-x_{n-2}$, we see that
\[
\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}=-\frac{zg}{1-x_iz}+\frac{zg}{1-x_{n-1}z} \text{ for all $0 \le i < n-1$}.
\]
Let 
\[
F(z) =\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (g-1)^k\right).
\]
Note that $F(z)$ is symmetric and $F_a(z)=\frac{F(z)}{1-x_az}$ for all $a$. Then we see that for all $0 \le i < n-1$ we have 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_i}%&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (g-1)^k\right)\\
&=\left(\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}k\binom{c}{k}(g-1)^{k-1}\right)\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_i}\\
&=\left(-\frac{z}{1-x_iz}+\frac{z}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}k\binom{c}{k}(g-1)^{k-1}\right)g\\
%&=\left(-\frac{z}{1-x_iz}+\frac{z}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}(k+1)\binom{c}{k+1}(g-1)^{k}\right)g\\
%&=\left(-\frac{z}{1-x_iz}+\frac{z}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}c\binom{c-1}{k}(g-1)^{k}\right)(g-1+1)\\
&=\left(-\frac{z}{1-x_iz}+\frac{z}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)\left(\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}c\binom{c-1}{k}(g-1)^{k}\right)+\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}c\binom{c-1}{k}(g-1)^{k+1}\right)\right)\\
%&=\left(-\frac{z}{1-x_iz}+\frac{z}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)\left(\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}c\binom{c-1}{k}(g-1)^{k}\right)+\left(\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}c\binom{c-1}{k-1}(g-1)^{k}\right)\right)\\
%&=\left(-\frac{z}{1-x_iz}+\frac{z}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)\left(-c\binom{c-1}{p-1}(g-1)^{p-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}c\binom{c}{k}(g-1)^{k}\right)\\
&=\left(-\frac{zc}{1-x_iz}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)\left(-\binom{c-1}{p-1}(g-1)^{p-1}+F(z)\right).\\
\end{align*}
We define
\[
G_i(z)=\left(-\frac{zc}{1-x_iz}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)\left(-\binom{c-1}{p-1}(g-1)^{p-1}\right).
\]
Then we see that 
\[
\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_i}=G_i(z)+\left(-\frac{zc}{1-x_iz}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)F(z).
\]
We can now calculate $\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial x_1},\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial x_0}$. 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial x_1}%&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\left(\frac{1}{1-x_0z}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (g-1)^k\right)\right)\\
&=\frac{1}{1-x_0z}\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_1}\\
&=\frac{1}{1-x_0z}\left(-\frac{zc}{1-x_1z}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)F(z)+\frac{G_1(z)}{1-x_0z}\\
&=\left(-\frac{zc}{1-x_1z}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)F_0(z)+\frac{G_1(z)}{1-x_0z}.\\
\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial x_0}%&=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\left(\frac{1}{1-x_0z}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (g-1)^k\right)\right)\\
&=\frac{z}{(1-x_0z)^2}F(z)+\frac{1}{1-x_0z}\frac{\partial F}{\partial x_0}\\
&=\frac{z}{1-x_0z}F_0(z)+\frac{1}{1-x_0z}\left(-\frac{zc}{1-x_0z}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)F(z)+\frac{G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}\\
%&=\frac{z}{1-x_0z}F_0(z)+\left(-\frac{zc}{1-x_0z}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)F_0(z)+\frac{G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}\\
&=\left(\frac{z(1-c)}{1-x_0z}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)F_0(z)+\frac{G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}.\\
\end{align*}
We note that $F_0(z)$ is invariant under $s_{ij}$ where $0 < i,j$. Therefore for transpositions we need only consider transpositions of the form $s_{0i}$ for $0 < i \le n-1$. We see that 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1-s_{0i}}{x_0-x_i}(F_0)%&=\frac{1}{x_0-x_i}\left(\frac{F(z)}{1-x_0z}-\frac{F(z)}{1-x_iz}\right)\\
&=\frac{1}{x_0-x_i}\left(\frac{1}{1-x_0z}-\frac{1}{1-x_iz}\right)F(z)\\
%&=\frac{1}{x_0-x_i}\left(\frac{(1-x_iz)-(1-x_0z)}{(1-x_0z)(1-x_iz)}\right)F(z)\\
%&=\frac{x_0z-x_iz}{(1-x_0z)(1-x_iz)(x_0-x_i)}F(z)\\
&=\frac{z}{(1-x_iz)(1-x_0z)}F(z)\\
&=\frac{z}{1-x_iz}F_0(z).\\
\end{align*}
We recall that we need only consider the action of $D_1-D_0$ on $F_0(z)$. We consider $D_0F_0, D_1F_0$ separately first. We see that 
\[
D_0=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_0}-c\sum_{j > 0} \frac{1-s_{0j}}{x_0-x_j}\right), D_1=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}-c \frac{1-s_{01}}{x_1-x_0}\right)
\]
since $F_0$ is invariant under $s_{ij}$ where $0 < i,j$. 
\begin{align*}
D_0F_0&=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_0}-c\sum_{j > 0} \frac{1-s_{0j}}{x_0-x_j}\right)(F_0)\\
&=\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial x_0}-c\sum_{j > 0} \frac{1-s_{0j}}{x_0-x_j}(F_0)\\
&=\frac{G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}+\left(\frac{z(1-c)}{1-x_0z}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)F_0(z)-\sum_{j > 0} \frac{zc}{1-x_jz}F_0(z).\\
D_1F_0&=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}-c \frac{1-s_{01}}{x_1-x_0}\right)(F_0)\\
&=\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial x_1}+c \frac{1-s_{01}}{x_0-x_1}(F_0)\\
&=\frac{G_1(z)}{1-x_0z}+\left(-\frac{zc}{1-x_1z}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}\right)F_0(z)+\frac{zc}{1-x_1z}F_0(z)\\
&=\frac{G_1(z)}{1-x_0z}+\frac{zc}{1-x_{n-1}z}F_0(z).\\
\end{align*}
It is then easy to see that 
\[
(D_1-D_0)(F_0)=\frac{G_1-G_0}{1-x_0z}+\frac{z(c-1)}{1-x_0z}F_0+\sum_{j>0} \frac{zc}{1-x_jz}F_0.
\]
In order to show that the $p$th coefficient in this formal power series is $0$, we must consider $\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial z}$. 

We see easily that 
\[
\frac{\partial g}{\partial z} = g(z) \sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}.
\]
We now consider $\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}$.
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}%&=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (g-1)^k\right)\\
&=\left(\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}k\binom{c}{k}(g-1)^{k-1}\right)\frac{\partial g}{\partial z}\\
%&=\left(\sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}k\binom{c}{k}(g-1)^{k-1}\right)g(z)\\
%&=\left(\sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}(k+1)\binom{c}{k+1}(g-1)^{k}\right)g(z)\\
&=\left(\sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}c\binom{c-1}{k}(g-1)^{k}\right)(g-1+1)\\
%&=\left(\sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}\right)\left(\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}c\binom{c-1}{k}(g-1)^{k}\right)+\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}c\binom{c-1}{k}(g-1)^{k+1}\right)\right)\\
&=\left(\sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}\right)\left(\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-2}c\binom{c-1}{k}(g-1)^{k}\right)+\left(\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}c\binom{c-1}{k-1}(g-1)^{k}\right)\right)\\
&=\left(\sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}\right)\left(-c\binom{c-1}{p-1}(g-1)^{p-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}c\binom{c}{k}(g-1)^{k}\right)\\
&=\left(\sum_j \frac{-cx_j}{1-x_jz}\right)F(z)+\left(\sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}\right)\left(-c\binom{c-1}{p-1}(g-1)^{p-1}\right).
\end{align*}
We define 
\[
V(z)=\left(\sum_j \frac{-x_j}{1-x_jz}\right)\left(-c\binom{c-1}{p-1}(g-1)^{p-1}\right).
\]
Then we see that 
\[
\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}=V(z)+\left(\sum_j \frac{-cx_j}{1-x_jz}\right)F(z).
\]
From this it follows that
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial z} &= \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\frac{F(z)}{1-x_0z}\right)\\
&=\frac{1}{1-x_0z} \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}+\frac{x_0}{1-x_0z} F(z)\\
&=\frac{V(z)}{1-x_0z}+\frac{1}{1-x_0z}\left(\sum_j \frac{-cx_j}{1-x_jz}\right)F(z)+\frac{x_0}{(1-x_0z)^2} F(z)\\
&=\frac{V(z)}{1-x_0z}+\left(\sum_j \frac{-cx_j}{1-x_jz}\right)F_0(z)+\frac{x_0}{1-x_0z} F_0(z).\\
\end{align*}
We now again consider $(D_1-D_0)(F_0)$. Recall that $n \equiv 0 \bmod p$, so in particular we can add $n$ times any multiple of $F_0$ since that is $0$ in characteristic $p$. 
\begin{align*}
(D_1-D_0)(F_0)&=\frac{G_1(z)-G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}+\frac{z(c-1)}{1-x_0z}F_0+\sum_{j>0} \frac{zc}{1-x_jz}F_0\\
%&=\frac{G_1(z)-G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}-\frac{z}{1-x_0z}F_0+\sum_{j} \frac{zc}{1-x_jz}F_0\\
%&=\frac{G_1(z)-G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}-\frac{z}{1-x_0z}F_0+\left(\sum_{j} \frac{zc}{1-x_jz}F_0\right)-nzcF_0\\
&=\frac{G_1(z)-G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}-zF_0+zF_0-\frac{z}{1-x_0z}F_0+\left(\sum_{j} -zcF_0+\frac{zc}{1-x_jz}F_0\right)\\

&=\frac{G_1(z)-G_0(z)}{1-x_0z}-zF_0-z^2\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial z}+z^2\frac{V(z)}{1-x_0z}\\
&=\frac{G_1(z)-G_0(z)+z^2V(z)}{1-x_0z}-zF_0-z^2\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial z}.\\
\end{align*}
We consider $z^2V(z)$ and $G_i(z)$ for $i=0,1$. We note that $(g-1)^{p-1}$ divides $V(z)$ and $z(g-1)^{p-1}$ divides $G_i(z)$. Since the sum $\sum_{a=0}^{n-1} x_a$ is $0$, we see that $z^2 \mid g(z)-1$; therefore $z^{2p-2} \mid (g-1)^{p-1}$. Therefore $z^{p+1} \mid z^{2p-1} \mid G_i(z)$ and $z^{p+1} \mid z^{2p} \mid z^2V(z)$. (We note that $z^p \mid z^{2p-2} \mid V(z)$; this will be relevant later.)

Then we see that for $0 \le \ell \le p$ we have
\[
[z^\ell](z^2V(z))=[z^\ell]G_0(z)=[z^\ell]G_1(z)=0.
\]
Then we also have
\[
[z^\ell](G_1(z)-G_0(z)+z^2V(z))=0.
\]
Then $[z^p]\left(\frac{G_1-G_0+z^2V}{1-x_0z}\right)$ is $0$ since it is a linear combination of $[z^\ell](G_1(z)-G_0(z)+z^2V(z))$ for $0 \le \ell \le p$, so 
\[
[z^p]\left((D_1-D_0)(F_0)\right)=[z^p]\left(-zF_0-z^2\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial z}\right).
\]
Let $b=[z^{p-1}](F_0)$. We see that $[z^p](-zF_0)=-b$. Then $[z^{p-2}]\left(\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial z}\right)=(p-1)b=-b$, so $[z^p]\left(-z^2\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial z}\right)=b$. Therefore $[z^p]\left(-zF_0-z^2\frac{\partial F_0}{\partial z}\right)=-b+b=0$, so 
\[
[z^p]((D_1-D_0)(F_0))=(D_1-D_0)([z^p]F_0)=(D_1-D_0)f_0=0.
\]
By the symmetry of the $F_a$, this is the only Dunkl operator we need consider; it is clear that all the $f_a$ are killed by the Dunkl operators.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:linind} The $f_a$ for $a=0,\dots,n-2$ are linearly independent homogeneous polynomials of degree $p$.
\end{proposition} 

\begin{proof} 
We recall that $F_a(z)=\frac{1}{1-x_az}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (g-1)^k\right)=\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty x_a^kz^k\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (g-1)^k\right)$. It is then clear that $f_a$ is a homogeneous polynomial in the $x_i$ of degree $p$, since $[z^k]F_a(z)$ is a homogeneous polynomial in the $x_i$ of degree $k$ for all $k$ (this follows from the fact that this is true in both multiplicands in $F_a$). 

Assume $\sum_{a=0}^{n-2} \lambda_af_a=0$ for some $\lambda_a \in k$. Then in particular this must be true when we set $x_a=1$ and $x_i=0$ for $i \ne a,i < n-1$. (We let $x_{n-1}=-1$ so that $\sum x_i=0$.) Note that if this is the case that $g(z)=(1-z)(1+z)=1-z^2$, so 
\[
F_a(z)=\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty z^k\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (-z^2)^k\right)
\]
and 
\[
F_i(z)=\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty 0^kz^k\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (-z^2)^k\right)=\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k} (-z^2)^k
\]
for $n-1>i \ne a$.

Therefore we have $[z^p]F_a(z)=f_a=\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2} (-1)^k\binom{c}{k}=\binom{c-1}{(p-1)/2}$ and $[z^p]F_i(z)=f_i=0$ for $n-1>i \ne a$ (since $p > 2$). Since $c$ is generic, we can assume $\binom{c-1}{(p-1)/2} \ne 0$. Then since $\sum_{a=0}^{n-2} \lambda_af_a=0$, we see that $\lambda_a\binom{c-1}{(p-1)/2}=0$; then we must have $\lambda_a=0$.

By setting $x_a=1,x_{n-1}=-1$ and $x_i=0$ for $i \ne a, i \ne n-1$ for all $a=0,\dots,n-1$ in succession, we find that $\lambda_a=0$ for all $a$. Therefore the $f_a$ for $a=0,\dots,n-2$ are linearly independent as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:vand}Let $y_0, \ldots, y_{r - 1}$ be distinct elements of $k$.  Then the polynomials $b_i(z) = \prod_{j \neq i} (1 - y_j z)$ are linearly independent.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} 
Assume that for some $\lambda_i \in k$ we have $\sum_i \lambda_ib_i(z)=0$.  Then $\left(\prod_j (1-y_jz)\right)\left(\sum_i \frac{\lambda_i}{1-y_iz}\right)$ must be $0$ in the ring of formal power series. Therefore since the ring of power series is an integral domain, $\sum_i \frac{\lambda_i}{1-y_iz}=0$. Then in particular for $\ell=0,\dots,r-1$ we have $\sum_i \lambda_iy_i^\ell=0$.

This implies that the product of the Vandermonde matrix 
\[
\left(\begin{matrix} 1& 1& \dots& 1\\y_0&y_1&\dots&y_{r-1}\\\dots&\dots&\dots&\dots\\y_0^{r-1}&y_1^{r-1}&\dots&y_{r-1}^{r-1}\end{matrix}\right)
\]
with the column vector $(\lambda_0,\dots,\lambda_{r-1})$ is $0$; however since all the $y_i$ are distinct, the Vandermonde matrix has nonzero determinant $\prod_{0 \le i < j \le r-1} (y_i-y_j)$, implying that $\lambda_i=0$ for all $i$. 

Therefore the polynomials $b_i(z)$ are linearly independent as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:ci} Let $I \subseteq A$ be the ideal generated by $f_a$ for $a=0,\dots,n-2$. $A/I$ is a complete intersection. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof} 

We will show that if $x_0,\dots,x_{n-1} \in k$ satisfy $f_i(x_0,\dots,x_{n-1})=0$ for all $i$, then $x_0=\dots=x_{n-1}=0$. 

We suppose that the $x_i$ take the distinct values $\{y_0,\dots,y_{r-1}\}$ with multiplicity $m_i>0$; then since $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i=0$ we have $\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} m_iy_i=0$. 

Then $g(z)=(1-y_iz)^{m_i}$. Recall that
\[
F(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k}(g-1)^k.
\]

We assume that $y_i \ne 0$ for all $i$.

Define
\[
a(z)=\frac{1}{\prod_{i=0}^{r-1}(1-y_iz)}F(z).
\]
Recall that we showed
\[
F'(z)=V(z)+\left(\sum_j \frac{-cx_j}{1-x_jz}F(z)\right)=V(z)+\left(\sum_j \frac{-cm_jy_j}{1-y_jz}F(z)\right),
\]
where $[z^\ell]V(z)=0$ for $0 \le \ell \le p$. We then see that
\begin{align*}
a'(z)&=\frac{d}{dz}\left(\frac{1}{\prod_{i=0}^{r-1}(1-y_iz)}F(z)\right)\\
&=\frac{1}{\prod_{i=0}^{r-1}(1-y_iz)}F'(z)+\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}\frac{y_j}{(1-y_jz)\prod_{i=0}^{r-1}(1-y_iz)}F(z)\\
&=\frac{1}{\prod_{i=0}^{r-1}(1-y_iz)}\left(V(z)+\left(\sum_j \frac{-cm_jy_j}{1-y_jz}F(z)\right)\right)+\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}\frac{y_j}{1-y_jz}a(z)\\
&=\frac{V(z)}{\prod_{i=0}^{r-1}(1-y_iz)}+\left(\sum_j \frac{-cm_jy_j}{1-y_jz}a(z)\right)+\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}\frac{y_j}{1-y_jz}a(z)\\
&=\frac{V(z)}{\prod_{i=0}^{r-1}(1-y_iz)}-\left(\sum_j \frac{(m_jc-1)y_j}{1-y_jz}a(z)\right).
\end{align*}
Since $[z^\ell]V(z)=0$ for $0 \le \ell \le p$ we see that $\frac{V(z)}{\prod_{i=0}^{r-1}(1-y_iz)}=z^pb(z)$ for some power series $b(z)$. Therefore
\[
a'(z)=z^pb(z)-\sum_j \frac{(m_jc-1)y_j}{1-y_jz}a(z)
\]
for some power series $b(z)$.

Define $b_i(z)=\prod_{j \ne i} (1-y_jz)$ for $i=0,\dots,r-1$; then by Proposition~\ref{prop:vand} we see that the polynomials $b_i(z)$ are linearly independent. 

Note that for any $i$, $a(z)b_i(z)=\frac{1}{1-y_iz}F(z)$. Then in particular, we have 
\[
[z^p]a(z)b_i(z)=[z^p]\frac{1}{1-y_iz}F(z)=0
\]
Therefore for any $\lambda_i \in k$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lincomb}
\sum_{i=0}^{r-1} \lambda_i[z^p]a(z)b_i(z)=[z^p]\left( a(z)\sum_{i=0}^{r-1}\lambda_ib_i(z)\right)=0.
\end{equation}
Recall that the $b_i(z)$ are linearly independent; they also have degree at most $r-1$. Therefore for $0 \le k \le r-1$ we can choose $\{\lambda_i^k\}$ so that 
\[
\sum_i\lambda_i^kb_i(z)=z^k.
\]
Then if we use the $\lambda_i^k$ in Equation~\ref{eq:lincomb}, we see that $[z^p](a(z)z^k)=[z^{p-k}]a(z)=0$ for $k=0,\dots,r-1$. 

We will show that we must have $[z^0]a(z)=0$, a contradiction. Note that if $r > p$ then we have already shown that; therefore we assume $r \le p$. 

For any integer $\ell$ we define the Laurent polynomial 
\[
h_\ell(z)=z^{-\ell-r}\prod_i(1-y_iz).
\]
Then we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dz}( h_\ell(z) a(z)) &= -(l + r)z^{-1} h_\ell(z) a(z) - \sum_i \frac{y_i}{1 - y_iz} h_\ell(z) a(z) + h_\ell(z) a'(z) \\
&=  -(\ell + r)z^{-1} h_\ell(z) a(z) - \sum_i \frac{y_i}{1 - y_iz} h_\ell(z) a(z) - h_\ell(z) \sum_j \frac{(m_j c - 1)y_i}{1 - y_ijz} a(z)  + z^ph_\ell(z) b(z)\\
&= -(\ell + r)z^{-1} h_\ell(z) a(z) - \sum_i \frac{y_im_i c}{1 - y_iz} h_\ell(z) a(z) + z^ph_\ell(z) b(z)\\
&= -\left((\ell + r) z^{-1} + \sum_i \frac{y_im_i c}{1 - y_iz}\right) h_\ell(z) a(z) + z^ph_\ell(z) b(z).
\end{align*}
We note that 
\[
-\left((\ell + r) z^{-1} + \sum_i \frac{y_im_i c}{1 - y_iz}\right) h_\ell(z)
\]
is a Laurent polynomial with lowest degree term 
\[
- z^{-l-r-1} \left(\ell + r + \sum_i y_i m_i c\right) = - z^{-\ell-r-1}(\ell+ r)
\]
and highest degree term 
\[
- z^{-\ell - 1} (-1)^r  \prod_i y_i\left((\ell + r) - \sum_i m_i c\right).
\]
The lowest degree term of the formal power series $z^ph_\ell(z)b(z)$ has degree at least $p-\ell-r$. We note that we must have $[z^{-1}]\left(\frac{d}{dz}( h_\ell(z) a(z))\right)=0$. 

Then as long as $p-\ell-r \ge 0$, which is true when $\ell \le p-r$, we see that $[z^{-1}]\left(\frac{d}{dz}( h_\ell(z) a(z))\right)=0$ is a linear combination of $[z^\ell]a(z),[z^{\ell+1}]a(z),\dots,[z^{\ell+r}]a(z)$ in which $[z^\ell]a(z)$ has nonzero coefficient $ (-1)^r  \prod_i y_i\left((\ell + r) - \sum_i m_i c\right)$ - we can assume this is nonzero since $c$ is generic and none of the $y_i$ are $0$. Therefore we can write $[z^\ell]a(z)$ as a linear combination of $[z^{\ell+1}]a(z),\dots,[z^{\ell+r}]a(z)$ when $\ell \le p-r$. 

We see that since $[z^{p-r+1}]a(z)=\dots=[z^p]a(z)=0$, we can use induction starting with $\ell=p-r$ to show that $[z^\ell]a(z)=0$ for $\ell=p-r,p-r-1,\dots,0$. Therefore $[z^0]a(z)=0$; however, it is clear from the definition of $a(z)$ that this is not the case. Therefore we have a contradiction, so one of the $y_i$ is $0$.

We can assume without loss of generality that $y_{r-1}=0$. Then if $r>1$, we can go through the same argument again with $y_0,\dots,y_{r-2}$. We are able to do this because our calculation of $F'(z)$ and $V(z)$ so that $z^p \mid V(z)$ relies only on the fact that $\sum m_iy_i=0$, which will still be true if we leave out $y_{r-1}=0$. We will then find that one of the $y_i$ with $i < r-1$ is $0$, which gives a contradiction since the $y_i$ are distinct. Therefore we must have $r=1$ and $y_0=0$. 
\end{proof}

Using these propositions, we are able to prove the main theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main} The irreducible representation $A/J$  of $\HH_{\hbar,c}(\h)$ is a complete intersection with  Hilbert series $\left(\frac{1-t^p}{1-t}\right)^{n-1}$. The maximal ideal $J$ is generated by $[z^p]F_a(z)$ for the formal power series
\[
F_a(z)=\frac{1}{1-x_az} \prod_{j=0}^{n-1}\left( \sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \binom{c}{k}(-1+\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} (1-x_jz))^k\right) \text{ for $a=0,\dots,n-2$}.
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It suffices to show that the $f_a$ generate the ideal $J$ and that $A/J$ has Hilbert series $\left(\frac{1-t^p}{1-t}\right)^{n-1}$. 

By Propositions~\ref{prop:linind} and \ref{prop:ci}, $A/I$ is a complete intersection with $n-1$ generators of degree $p$. It then must have Hilbert series $h_{A/I}(t)=\left(\frac{1-t^p}{1-t}\right)^{n-1}$. By Proposition~\ref{prop:ann}, the generators of $I$ are annihilated by the Dunkl operators, so $I \subseteq J$.

By \cite[Proposition 3.4]{BC1}, we see that the Hilbert series of $A/J$ is $\left(\frac{1-t^p}{1-t}\right)^{n-1}h(t^p)$ for some polynomial $h$ with nonnegative integer coefficients; since $I \subseteq J$, we see that $h_{A/I}(t) \ge h_{A/J}(t)$ coefficient-wise; however by this restriction of the form of $h_{A/J}(t)$, we see that the only possible choice for $h$ is $h(t)=1$. Therefore $h_{A/I}(t)=h_{A/J}(t)$, so $I=J$ and these $n-1$ generators generate the whole ideal $J$.
